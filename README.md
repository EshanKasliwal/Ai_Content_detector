# AI-Content-Detector

Advanced language models such as ChatGPT and LLAMA2 have the capability to generate text that is not only coherent but also mirrors the realism of human writing. These models are versatile and can be utilized for a range of applications including but not limited to paraphrasing, summarizing, and question-answering. Despite their benefits, these AI models present certain challenges. One significant issue is their potential to disrupt academic integrity and content authenticity and complicate plagiarism detection.

Recognizing these challenges, this project aims to devise effective strategies to differentiate between text written by humans and that generated by ChatGPT. The cornerstone of this project is the development of a machine-learning model that leverages the Extra Trees Classifier. This model has been designed to accurately predict the origin of a piece of text, determining whether itâ€™s human-written or produced by ChatGPT.

The implications of this project are far-reaching. It will play a crucial role in preserving academic integrity and ensuring content authenticity by providing a reliable tool for content moderators and educators. This tool will enable them to verify the originality of the text, thereby fostering responsible and ethical practices in AI-generated content creation.
